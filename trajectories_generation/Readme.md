# trajectories_generation

Generate trajectories composed by three types of subtrajectory (line, circle and sine wave), which are then resampled to the desired frequency.
For each subtrajectory a constant, a ramp or a sine force is associated.
A randomizer allows the randomization choice of the parameters.
Both the generated and the resampled trajectories are saved in the output folder as .csv files.
The demo shows how this module works.
